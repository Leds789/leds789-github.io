Hello, world!

I am Matthew, a cybersec student and professional chef with a strong passion for computer science and hand-on learning. My journey has taken me from cooking to the world of IT where I'm currently trying to build my skills and certs up and hoping to eventually work in IT.

This site is where I plan to showcase my projects and learning
